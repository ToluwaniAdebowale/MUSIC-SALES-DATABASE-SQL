The information on the database:<br>
The Chinook Database holds information about a music store. <br>
Questions I answered from the database:<br>
Which city has the best customers?<br>
1. We would like to throw a promotional Music Festival in the city we made the most money. Write a query that returns the 1 city that has the highest sum of invoice totals. Return both the city name and the sum of all invoice totals.<br>
2. Which countries have the most Invoices?<br>
Tip: Use the Invoice table to determine the countries that have the most invoices. Provide a table of BillingCountry and Invoices ordered by the number of invoices for each country. The country with the most invoices should appear first.<br>
3. Who is the best customer?<br>
Tip: The customer who has spent the most money will be declared the best customer. Build a query that returns the person who has spent the most money<br>
4. Use your query to return the email, first name, last name, and Genre of all Rock Music listeners. Return your list ordered alphabetically by email address starting with A.<br>
5. We want to find out the most popular music Genre for each country. We determine the most popular genre as the genre with the highest amount of purchases. Write a query that returns each country along with the top Genre. For countries where the maximum number of purchases is shared return all Genres.<br>
Tip: For this query, you will need to use the Invoice, InvoiceLine, Customer, Track, and Genre tables.
